Python scripts can be really simple.  As simple as a single line.  They can also
grow to be extremely powerful and are used many places for many purposes.

To create your first Python script, go to [this online interpreter site](https://repl.it/languages/python3).

When you open the online interpreter, you'll see a page that looks like this: ![Python Interpreter](/assets/pythonrepl.png).

To use the interpreter, you enter your program on the left and click the Run button. You will be able to see the output
of your program on the right.

When you first load the page, the script box will be pre-loaded with a one line Python script that simply prints the text
`Hello, World!`. When you click the Run button you will see the output.

This is about as simple of a program as you can get in Python. It consists of one statement, and the one statement prints
some text.

You can change and customize this program by changing the text that is inside the quotes. For example, if you change
`print('Hello, world!')` to `print('Hello, world, from me!')` it will print the new text.
