Now that we've completed a brief introduction to Python, and a brief introduction to what the NodeMCU is,
we are ready to power up the NodeMCU and connect it to the computer.

To start, locate the breadboard that came in the provided kit. It will look like the picture below:

Then, locate the bag with the NodeMCU board in it. Take the NodeMCU and gently, but firmly, press its pins
into the holes in the breadboard so that it is oriented as in the photo below:

Once you have inserted your NodeMCU board into the breadboard, you are ready to connect it to your computer.
To do so, you'll need a micro USB cable. The small end of your cable should be connected to the micro USB port
of the NodeMCU board, and the large end should be connected to the USB port on your computer. When you do this,
a blue light on the NodeMCU should flash once.

Now that the NodeMCU board has been connected to the computer, you are ready to connect to it and run your first
Python script on it.

To do so, you'll need to install software on your computer to connect to board. How this is done depends on whether
you are using an Apple computer or a Windows computer. If you are using an Apple computer, you should open up the App
Store and search for 'serialtools'. Install the program that is found in the search, and when it has finished
installing, open it.

If you are using a Windows computer, you should download and install a program called [Putty](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/putty/windows/install).
